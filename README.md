## TODO
- Gluten free, dairy free, low beta carotene, low vitamin A, low sulfur
- Bin foods by nutrient (quartiles)
- get health effects of a given meal
- preprocess data to minimize file size, or import to postgres?
- cache base data frames in memory
- backup dataset
- unit test with df.head() as mock
- compounds contain greek Î² AND regular "beta"
